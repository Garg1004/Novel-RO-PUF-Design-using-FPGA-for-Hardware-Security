# Novel-RO-PUF-Design-using-FPGA-for-Hardware-Security
This project presents a novel Ring Oscillator Physical Unclonable Function (RO-PUF) design implemented on the Basys 3 FPGA board (Xilinx Artix-7) using Vivado Design Suite. The design focuses on achieving low power consumption and enhanced response quality using a custom RO selector mechanism and a Double Feynman gate-based architecture.
